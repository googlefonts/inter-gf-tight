This is a specialized version of [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter)
with tighter spacing, for use with software that does not provide control over
letter spacing (like for example Google Workspace.)
Please consider using standard Inter in scenarios where you can control spacing
(like on web pages, in Figma, Adobe Illustrator, etc.)

Space differences in UPM, compared to Inter:

- Thin:      0 U
- Regular: -48 U
- Black:   -24 U

Note: This version of Inter may not receive updates and improvements like
the [standard Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) does.
